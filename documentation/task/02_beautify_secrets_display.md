# Task: Beautify Secrets Display - Enhanced Styling

## Description

The user requested to make the display of secrets in the "my secrets" page more beautiful and readable. The existing implementation showed the secret content as a raw, stringified JSON.
An initial improvement parsed the JSON and displayed it as key-value pairs. This task further refines the visual presentation.

## Requirements

- Center the entire secrets table on the page.
- Apply more distinct and organized styling to the displayed key-value pairs within the secret content cell.
  - Ensure keys are clearly distinguishable from values.
  - Improve spacing and alignment of key-value pairs.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The "secrets" table (including its heading) is horizontally centered on the page.
- Key-value pairs within the secret content are displayed with clear visual separation (e.g., spacing, alignment).
- The overall look and feel of the secrets display is more polished and user-friendly than the previous iteration.
